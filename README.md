# Travel agency information system 

In this project, 15 members participated with a common goal of building an application that would be useful for both tourists, who can embark on adventures, and tour creators, who can publish their tours. 

Authors can create tours, publish them, enhance them with various challenges and secrets, and create packages to offer more competitive prices or to bundle less popular tours with more popular ones.

Tourists can purchase, start tours, complete challenges, connect with each other, and enrich their travel experience in a simple way.

The project was carried out using the SCRUM agile methodology for software development. We held weekly sprints where we discussed each software increment. We used a Trello board for writing user stories, where SCRUM masters assigned tasks to other team members, allowing us to easily track the project's progress.

Additionally, we had several meetings with our clients where we gathered user requirements, discussed potential issues and solutions, and received their feedback on testing the application.

At the end of the project, we conducted a presentation where we showcased our projects to the entire generation, professors, and assistants, striving to effectively "sell" our product.

## Technologies

- ***Server platform***: C# + .NET (ASP.NET)

- ***Client platform***: Angular + REST services

- ***Database***: Relational Database (PostgreSQL)

For the server-side (back-end), we used C# with the ASP.NET framework, while for the client-side (front-end), we used TypeScript, HTML, and CSS within the Angular framework.

Data storage was handled using a relational database (PostgreSQL).
